Javascript library for OpenCPU
------------------------------

This is an early version of a Javascript client library for the OpenCPU API (www.opencpu.org)

The library depends on jQuery. Most functions in the library will return a *jqxhr* object. This gives you full control over the ajax request!

Features
--------

The library exports one variable to the global namespace called `opencpu`.
